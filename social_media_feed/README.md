# Social Media Feed with Infinite Scrolling

This is a **React** application that demonstrates **infinite scrolling** functionality. The application fetches posts from an API as the user scrolls down, and it loads more posts in real-time when the end of the page is reached.

## Features

- **Infinite Scrolling**: Automatically fetches more posts when the user reaches the bottom of the page.
- **Real-Time Data Loading**: New data is fetched dynamically from an API as the user scrolls.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on all screen sizes, including mobile devices.
